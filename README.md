Sophy is an uci compliant chess engine. I wrote this engine in Haskell so that I can get used to functional programming.
Hopefully, this could provide some intuition for your own chess programs.
The engine is still very weak, and not all the uci commands have been supported.
However, if you just want to play with it or let it match against other engines without some uci commands,
feel free to do so, and I would appreciate your kind feedbacks.
